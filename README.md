# LIProgressRing


[![Carthage Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

LIProgressRing contains the ProgressRingView class that displays a timer using rings.
The advantage of this class is that you can add any view to the center. 
Other frameworks don't seem to have built in ways of adding custom views. This framework simply designs the view an it leaves everything else to you.

## Usage 


Run the example project to see the framework in action.

## Installation

For simplicity cocoa-pods is not used. This framework does **not** and will not use 3rd party libraries. You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) or install it manually without worrying about managing a complex framework that imports other frameworks.
